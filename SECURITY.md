# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version of the code is actively supported, and any security updates will be applied to this version. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of the code and report any issues or vulnerabilities discovered in older versions.

## Security Policies and Best Practices
This document outlines the security policies and best practices for our GitHub repository containing a complete C++ placement and DSA course.

## Access Control
Access to the repository should be limited to only authorized individuals. This can be done by using GitHub's built-in access controls or by integrating with an external authentication system. All users should have strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) should be enabled.

## Code Analysis
Automated code analysis tools should be used to detect vulnerabilities, bugs, and potential security issues in the code. This can be done by integrating with third-party tools like CodeQL or by setting up custom analysis scripts. The results of the analysis should be reviewed regularly by authorized users and any issues should be addressed promptly.

## Code Reviews
Code review policies should be enforced to ensure that changes are thoroughly reviewed before being merged into the main branch. This can be done by setting up pull request templates, requiring specific reviewers, or using code review tools. All code changes should be reviewed and approved by at least two other authorized users before being merged into the main branch.

## Secure Coding Standards
Secure coding standards and guidelines should be established to ensure that all code follows best practices for security. This can be done by creating a security checklist or by providing training to developers. All code changes should follow these guidelines and any deviations should be reviewed and approved by authorized users.

## Security Testing
Regular security testing should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats. This can be done by using automated security testing tools or by conducting manual penetration testing. The results of the testing should be reviewed regularly by authorized users and any issues should be addressed promptly.

## Incident Response
An incident response plan should be established to ensure that any security incidents are handled promptly and effectively. The plan should include procedures for identifying, containing, investigating, and reporting security incidents. All users should be trained on the incident response plan and any incidents should be reported immediately to authorized users.

## Reporting Security Issues
Any security issues or vulnerabilities should be reported immediately to authorized users. The report should include details about the issue, including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested solutions. Users should not disclose the issue publicly until it has been addressed and resolved.

## Conclusion
Following these security policies and best practices can help ensure the security and integrity of our GitHub repository containing a complete C++ placement and DSA course. All users should be familiar with these policies and should follow them consistently.
